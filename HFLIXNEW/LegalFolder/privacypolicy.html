      <hr>

      <p>We respect your privacy and strive to protect the privacy of your personal data. We recognize that the exciting growth of the Internet and online services has raised questions about the nature, use, and confidentiality of the information collected about consumers.

        <br>
        By providing us with your personal information, you agree to this privacy statement and the collection, use, access, transmission, storage and processing of your personal information described in this privacy statement.<br>
